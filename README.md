# Analysis of COVID-19

## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant challenges in managing the virus's impact across diverse populations worldwide. Many regions struggle to understand and address the disparities in infection rates, healthcare outcomes, and testing availability among different communities. Additionally, there are critical issues in effectively allocating resources, developing appropriate public health strategies, and ensuring equitable healthcare access. Using a detailed recorded data regarding the disease, we can analyze and visualize the complex dynamics influencing COVID-19 outcomes across various countries and regions, providing policymakers and health organizations with actionable insights to enhance their strategies and reduce the impact of future pandemics.
